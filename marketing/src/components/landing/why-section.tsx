        WHY behind YouClick!
      </div>
      <div className="text-center">
        You might have heard youtuber requesting you to like, comment and
        subscribe to their channel, ever wonder why they tell you in each
        video?? because we tend to binge watch and forget to shower the support
        to that video or youtube channel just because we are LAZY to exit the
        full screen and manually do the work! Imagine you are watching a
        playlist of 100 videos, will you exit the full screen everytime and
        comment?? This includes a lot of friction and high probability that you
        will not comment and like on each video. And due to this, your favorite
        youtuber might not get the appreciation he/she deserves. This is exactly
        where YouClick took a birth.
