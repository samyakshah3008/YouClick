## Why Behind YouClick:

You might have heard youtuber requesting you to like, comment and subscribe to their channel, ever wonder why they tell you in each video?? because we tend to binge watch and forget to shower the support to that video or youtube channel just because we are LAZY to exit the full screen and manually do the work! Imagine you are watching a playlist of 100 videos, will you exit the full screen everytime and comment?? This includes a lot of friction and high probability that you will not comment and like on each video. And due to this, your favorite youtuber might not get the appreciation he/she deserves. This is exactly where YouClick took a birth.

## Key features:
